# C_Programming_Language
This repository is created as a resource for starting to learn C programming language. The repository is divided into 9 modules. Each module has some example codes explaining soome concepts / syntax. There is an additional section that contains the expected output upon execution of the code.<br>

<!-- 1. Introduction -->
## 1. Introduction
This module deals with very basic codes that include printing and reading inputs and data types. The major data types : int, long, char, float, double are explained.<br>
<!-- 2. Basic Decision Control -->
## 2. Basic Decision Control
Control statements are introduced in this module. Example code starts with simple if condition statements and goes upto switch case.<br>
<!-- 3. Loop Structures -->
## 3. Loop Structures
Loops are used to run same set of statements repetitvely for a given number of times (this can be sometimes infinite or undefined / not quantified). The 3 loop structures ; for, while and do while are programmed. An example code is present for nested loops. Break, continue and goto statements are also used. <br>
<!-- 4. Functions and pointers -->
## 4. Functions and Pointers
Functions are used in a program to use same set instructions again when required. They make a program more maintainable. Pointers are C constructs that point to a particular memory location. Use of both together makes it possible to perform complex tasks.<br>
<!-- 5. Operators -->
## 5. Operators
Operators are used in almost evey instruction directly or indirectly. There exists arithmetic, relational, logical, and bitwise operators in C. They are used separately or in combination.<br>
<!-- 6. Arrays -->
## 6. Arrays.
Arrays are set of data variables occupying  contiguous block of memory of are of same data type. They are linear data structures used extensively. Pointers can be used for accessing / modifing elements of an array. Single as well as 2 dimensional arrays are passed as input arguments to functions.<br>
<!-- 7. Strings -->
## 7. Strings
Strings are special character arrays where the last characher is the terminating character ('\0'). Different string declartions and initializations are used. Some basic string manipulation functions are explained in the example codes.<br>
<!-- 8. Structures -->
## 8. Structures
Structures are user defined data type. They are used extensively in programs for device drivers, low level layers, embedded applications, etc. Theses structures can have a single variable or an array. They too can be accessed and modified using pointers.<br>
<!-- 9. Files -->
## 9. Files
This last module is about file handling in C.  The basic operations are reading, writing and appending in a file are explained in the example code.
